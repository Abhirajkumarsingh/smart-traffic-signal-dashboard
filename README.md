# 🚦 Smart Traffic Signal Dashboard  
*A simple front-end simulation of an AI-based traffic light system.*

This project simulates how an intelligent traffic system can detect an **ambulance** from camera feeds and automatically switch the traffic signal from **RED → GREEN** for emergency passage.

I built this project around 1.5 years ago when exploring how AI can be used in traffic automation.  
This is a **front-end only demo** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with simulated camera images.

## 📝 Project Overview

A simple front-end simulation of a smart traffic system that detects ambulances and turns the signal **GREEN** automatically.  
The dashboard rotates camera feeds every few seconds and updates the signal status based on predefined detection logic.

Built 1.5 years ago using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project shows how emergency vehicle detection could work in a real AI-powered traffic environment.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Images are pre-loaded inside an array.  
- Every **3 seconds**, the dashboard:
  - Loads next image  
  - Checks if ambulance = true  
  - Updates traffic light from Red → Green  
  - Updates UI status  

This is only a **simulation**, not actual AI.

## 🚀 How to Run

Just open **index.html** in any browser.  
No setup needed.

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Python + OpenCV real ambulance detection  
- YOLO model integration  
- Real traffic signal timing logic  
- Dark/Light theme toggle
